A short-sleeve style could be ideal for comfort.\n\n2. **Bottoms**: Pair the shirt with well-fitted chinos or tailored shorts, depending on the weather. Darker colors like navy or charcoal work well and keep the look sharp.\n\n3. **Footwear**: Choose comfortable loafers or clean white sneakers for a polished yet relaxed vibe.\n\n4. **Layer**: If it’s a bit cooler, consider adding a lightweight blazer or a casual bomber jacket that enhances your silhouette without being too restrictive.\n\n5. **Accessories**: Complete your look with a leather or canvas belt, and maybe a stylish watch. Depending on your comfort, a pair of minimalistic sunglasses can also add a nice touch.\n\nThis ensemble gives you a smart casual look while ensuring you feel comfortable throughout the day. Enjoy your day!"
